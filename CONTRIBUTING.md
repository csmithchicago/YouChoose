# Contributing to YouChoose

All contribution no matter the size is welcome and encouraged. From spelling and grammar mistakes to implementing new state of the art research methods.

Some formatting guidelines need to be met for contributions to be accepted and merged into the YouChoose project. Pep8 and Black formatting are strictly enforced through the use of pre-commit hooks during continuous integration tests with Travis-CI.

Contributions must also pass unit tests and include new tests if the features warrant testing.
